## About

Junior Software Developer at **Funbutler AB** in Lund, where I work on payment integrations, onboarding flows, and product features. Outside of work I run **Gustavsson Development** — a freelance practice building end-to-end web solutions for clients.

I came from five years as an emergency technician at Region Skåne, which means I'm used to high-pressure environments and debugging things that really shouldn't be broken. I've carried that same mentality into software.

Currently exploring medical technology on the side.
